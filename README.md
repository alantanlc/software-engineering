## Organization

Analyze the work, break it down into actionable pieces, and determine your definition of success.

- Break work down into smaller pieces
- Capture all the necessary information for each task
- Clearly specify the ultimate goal of each task
- Come up with a way to measure success

## Estimation & Commitment

Estimate the work, and ensure you feel comfortable making a commitment.

- Provide a high-level effort estimation for every task
- Estimate the value that every task adds to the project
- Determine whether all the work is doable by the end of the iteration

## Prioritization

Prioritize all the tasks to find the most important one to focus on next.

- This works like a bubble sort algorithm
- Either try to maximize throughput or minimize risk
- In the end, the top task is the one that moves on

## Execution

Most of the fun happens here. This is about getting work done.

- Think and design your solution
- Run some experiments
- Build the solution
- Test everything
- Make things pretty

## Review & Delivery

Don't toss things over the wall. Make sure you are properly handling them over after you meet the goal.

- Ensure you are fully meeting the goal of the task
- This is a good opportunity to test everything beyond any unit testing you might have done
- If there are downline dependencies, make sure you hand your work appropriately
- This is also a great time to add documentation

## Presentation

Now it's time to present all the work to the team and stakeholders.

- What's the appropriate language to use?
- What aspects of the work should be highlighted?
- How should I communicate the value of the work?
- What aspects of the work should be omitted?

## Reflection

At the end of the iteration, reflect on everything that happened to aim to identify ways to improve.

- How did the iteration go?
- What were the lessons learned?
- What can be done to improve?
- How did the team receive the work?
- What's the temperature of the project and stakeholders?
